For my ethical quandry I choose the Snowden NSA leaks. The ethical quandries I identified were: Legal/illegal government collection of citizen's data, 
Snowden illegally leaking clasified information, The government wanting to arrest a whistleblower, and how Snowdens leak could've resonably damaged national security.

The systems I identified were: Government, public trust in government, foreign relations, national security, and the privacy of citizens. The government's collection of data
affected the privacy of citizens and foreign relations (data also collected from other countries citizens). While the leak by Snowden affected the government, and the trust in government.
