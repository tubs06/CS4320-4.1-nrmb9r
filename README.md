For my ethical quandry I choose the Snowden NSA leaks. The ethical quandries I identified were: Legal/illegal government collection of citizen's data, 
Snowden illegally leaking clasified information, The government wanting to arrest a whistleblower, and how Snowdens leak could've resonably damaged national security.

The systems I identified were: Government, public trust in government, foreign relations, national security, and the privacy of citizens.
